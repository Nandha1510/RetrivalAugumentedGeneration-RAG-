### **Project Title: DeepDive AI â€“ Intelligent Research Paper Analyzer**  
---
#### **Project Description:**  
In the era of information overload, researchers and professionals struggle to extract meaningful insights from vast amounts of academic literature. **DeepDive AI** is an advanced **AI-powered research paper analysis tool** that leverages **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, and **Vector Search** to enhance literature review efficiency.  

This project enables users to upload multiple **PDF research papers**, automatically extract and preprocess text, and retrieve the most relevant sections based on user queries. By integrating **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)** for efficient vector retrieval and **OpenAIâ€™s GPT models** for intelligent summarization, DeepDive AI provides **contextually rich responses** to complex research questions.  

With an interactive **Streamlit UI**, this tool offers seamless document processing, fast semantic search, and AI-generated insights, making it an essential assistant for academics, students, and professionals.
